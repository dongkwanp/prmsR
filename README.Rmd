## prmsR

`prmsR` is a R wrapper of USGS's [Precipitation Runoff Modelling System (PRMS)](https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/SW_MoWS/PRMS.html) intended to be used by [University of Massachusetts Amherst Hydrosystems Research Group](http://blogs.umass.edu/hydrosystems/).  The function of this library is to:

1. Integrate the PRMS Model within R's data and file systems
2. The ability for easier parallel computing runs of PRMS

## Dependencies

`prmsR` will automatically install the required dependencies when installed.  However, manual installation of dependencies are possible by executing the following command:

```
install.packages('tidyr')
```

In addition, the `prms` binary (which can be obtained [here](https://www.usgs.gov/software/precipitation-runoff-modeling-system-prms-0)) is necessary.   

## Installation Instructions

`prmsR` is in constant development.  Therefore, using the most up-to-date version of the library is recommended.  This library can be accessed via HTTPS or SSH.  Both options are outlined below.  You only need to follow one method that works for you.  

### Access via HTTPS

Within R, execute the following lines in order to install `prmsR`.  

```
install.packages(c('devtools', 'git2r'))
devtools::install_git('https://projects.cloudwaterlab.com/UMass/prmsR.git')
```

### Access via SSH


```
install.packages(c('git2r', 'devtools'))
devtools::install_git("git@projects.cloudwaterlab.com:UMass/prmsR.git")
```


## How to Use

Call the library using the following command.

```
library('prmsR')
```

## Troubleshooting

`prmsR` has been tested and is in regular use on the Linux environment.  However, the code should be platform neutral and work with Windows or MacOS systems as well.
