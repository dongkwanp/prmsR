## prmsR

`prmsR` is a R wrapper of USGS's [Precipitation Runoff Modelling System (PRMS)](https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/SW_MoWS/PRMS.html) intended to be used by [University of Massachusetts Amherst Hydrosystems Research Group](http://blogs.umass.edu/hydrosystems/).  The function of this library is to:

1. Integrate the PRMS Model within R's data and file systems
2. Easier parallel computing runs of PRMS
3. ????
4. Profit

If something breaks.  Don't ask Don.  He doesn't know.  It just somehow works.  Like magic.
